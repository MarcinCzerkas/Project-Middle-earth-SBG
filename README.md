# Introduction

The idea behind this **data analysis** project is to collect all possible data on how we play a tabletop game🎲, when we play it, what are the results, who wins more often etc., store it in one database and deep dive into it by building an interactive Power BI dashboard.📊

This is just a glance of the final effect:

Additionally, this short [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SM1gzG1eIOc) showcases the whole project.🎬

This file presents the project in a short and (hopefully) comprehensible way. For more details, check out the [Project Documentation](/Project%20Documentation%20(README)%20-%20ME%20SBG%20Interactive%20Dashboard.pdf).🗃️

# Background

The main idea was to build an interactive dashboard in Power BI which would allow the users to **learn more about 
details related to the game** and our local community, for example: how different players build their armies in the game,
what are the patterns in their behaviour, which army won the biggest number of games. In order to do this, I deep 
dived into the tools I wanted to use and learned new things or refreshed my knowledge about them.

I decided to work on this project for two reasons. Firstly, because I am really into the game (call me a nerd if you 
like!). Secondly, because I wanted to use this opportunity to showcase my skills in data analysis. I thought a **combination of hobby🎲 and more work-oriented passion📈** would make a perfect project.👌

# Tools I Used

- **PostgreSQL** - database management system that allowed me to design and populate a database for my project
- **SQL** - Structured Query Language I used to communicate with the database
- **Power BI** - data visualization tool where I built the final dashboard
- **DAX** - Data Analysis Expressions language that allowed me to write measures and queries inside of Power BI

*Data Model I created for this project. It was originally set up in PostgreSQL, then imported and managed in Power BI Desktop*

# The Analysis - Key Insights

To keep things concise, I prepared a list of 5 bullet points containing my main findings:

- The prevalent army type is *single army* (over **50%** of all armies).

- The game is played less and less over time in our local community (unfortunately!).

- On  average,  the  **expenses**  in  terms  of  points  in  an  army  are  **divided  equally  to  heroes  and  warriors**  (with heroes having a slight prevalence).

- The most popular points format is **800 pts**. *Maelstrom* is the least popular deployment type in scenarios (only 
10% of games).

- The most frequently used models are ***orcs***. 

# Conclusion

❓How relevant is my project in terms of a possible business use❓

Well, unless your business has at least something to do with selling miniatures for tabletop games, this project as such 
presents very little value😄. However, the idea behind it is quite universal and can be applied in different areas. What I 
tried to showcase is the ability to extract as much data as possible, be accurate in designing databases and be creative 
in building dashboards.📊

Working on this project has been great fun for me. I could test my skills and keep learning new ones. Can’t wait to do 
more similar projects!🎉
